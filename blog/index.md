# Welcome to my blog

> It's been a long time... - GLaDOS, Aperture Laboratories

I've been doing cyber for a few years now, but never blogged any of it.  That was a mistake.  So, I figured there's no time like the present to start!
There will be a really large variety of posts here, so take a seat, grab a drink, and enjoy the chaos.  I hope you learn something in your time here.

Feel free to email me at darkwire@duck.com
